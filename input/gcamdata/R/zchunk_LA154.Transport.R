#' module_gcamusa_LA154.Transport
#'
#' Downscale transportation energy consumption and nonmotor data to the state level, generating three ouput tables.
#'
#' @param command API command to execute
#' @param ... other optional parameters, depending on command
#' @return Depends on \code{command}: either a vector of required inputs,
#' a vector of output names, or (if \code{command} is "MAKE") all
#' the generated outputs: \code{L154.in_EJ_state_trn_m_sz_tech_F}, \code{L154.out_mpkm_state_trn_nonmotor_Yh}, \code{L154.in_EJ_state_trn_F}. The corresponding file in the
#' original data system was \code{LA154.Transport.R} (gcam-usa level1).
#' @details Transportation energy data was downscaled in proportion to EIA state-level transportation energy data
