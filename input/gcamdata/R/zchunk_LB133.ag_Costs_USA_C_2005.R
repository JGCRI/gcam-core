#' module_aglu_LB133.ag_Costs_USA_C_2005
#'
#' This module computes costs for each GCAM commodity (used by each region-GLU) using USDA cost
#' information for USA when available. For commodities without USDA cost data, the average profit
#' among USDA commodities and LDS harvested area and production information are used to compute
#' cost.
#'
#' @param command API command to execute
#' @param ... other optional parameters, depending on command
#' @return Depends on \code{command}: either a vector of required inputs,
#' a vector of output names, or (if \code{command} is "MAKE") all
#' the generated outputs: \code{L133.ag_Cost_75USDkg_C}. The corresponding file in the
#' original data system was \code{LB133.ag_Costs_USA_C_2005.R} (aglu level1).
#' @details USDA cost information is scaled to the level of GCAM commodity using LDS harvested area and
#' production data to compute weighting factors for aggregation and convert cost from USD/square meter
#' to the more useful USD/kg. Cost information is converted to the GCAM base of 1975 USD before aggregation.
#' For commodities without USDA cost information, the average profit among USDA commodities is combined
#' with LDS harvested area and production data to calculate cost.
