  # Future development: code related to off-shore wind technologies will go here.


  # NOTES: Differences from original script data output
  # Note 1: All "no cooling" plant_types are now assinged "fresh" water_type. In old data wind
  # and rooftop_pv were assigned "none" water_type while hydro, PV, PV_storage were assigned "fresh".
  # Note 2: In CA for fuel == coal the original script uses a US average distribution. However, in this script when
  # future technologies do not exist in a state (past 1999) in the UCS database then it is assumed that those technologies do not have
  # a representative share based on the US average. The distribution is based on the assumptions made above for dry cooling, recirculating,
  # once through.
  # Note 3: rooftop_pv in the original script has no shares assigned to it. In this script all technologies have summed shares == 1. In this
  # case the cooling system is "none" with a share of 1.
