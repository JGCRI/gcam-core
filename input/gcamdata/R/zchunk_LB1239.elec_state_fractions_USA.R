#' module_gcamusa_LB1239.elec_state_fractions_USA
#'
#' Map electricity generation by fuel | grid region | horizontal segment to generation by fuel | state | segment.
#' The fraction of generation by fuel by horizontal segment is assumed to be equal for all states within a grid region.
#'
#' @param command API command to execute
#' @param ... other optional parameters, depending on command
#' @return Depends on \code{command}: either a vector of required inputs,
#' a vector of output names, or (if \code{command} is "MAKE") all
#' the generated outputs: \code{L1239.state_elec_supply_USA}.
#'
#' The corresponding file in the original data system was \code{LB1239.elec_state_fractions.R} (gcam-usa level1).
#' @details Calculates the fraction of electricity generation by fuel, by horizontal load segment, by state.
