#' module_gcamusa_LA1321.cement
#'
#' Allocate across the states national cement production, input-output cofficients, and energy inputs to cement production
#'
#' @param command API command to execute
#' @param ... other optional parameters, depending on command
#' @return Depends on \code{command}: either a vector of required inputs,
#' a vector of output names, or (if \code{command} is "MAKE") all
#' the generated outputs: \code{L1321.out_Mt_state_cement_Yh}, \code{L1321.IO_GJkg_state_cement_F_Yh}, \code{L1321.in_EJ_state_cement_F_Y}. The corresponding file in the
#' original data system was \code{LA1321.Cement.R} (gcam-usa level1).
#' @details The tables for cement production, i.e., out, and energy inputs, i.e., in, were calculated by applying state shares to national data.
#' @details The state shares were determined by the states' relative values of cement shipments.
#' @details The input-out coefficients were downscaled to the states in proportation to the national data.
