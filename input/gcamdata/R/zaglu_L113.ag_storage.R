    # Storage cost shares summary ----
    # There is no available data of storage cost worldwide
    # Based on the data points shown above (grains), the cost shares (marginal; second-half of the year)
    # are usually in 2 - 7%
    # However, the difference between the cost for interannual storage vs average storage is not clear.
    # Storage cost vs. market price of commercial storage service could be another source of uncertainty.
    # Here we will assume 3% of the price is the storage cost everywhere in all sectors.
