#' @param command API command to execute
#' @param ... other optional parameters, depending on command
#' @return Depends on \code{command}: either a vector of required inputs,

#' @details This chunk combines all flow tables of GCAM agricultural commodities, calculates mass balances by
#' GCAM region, commodity and year, and adjusts global and regional net exports to remove negative other uses.
