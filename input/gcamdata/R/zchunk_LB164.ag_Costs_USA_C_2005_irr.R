#' module_aglu_LB164.ag_Costs_USA_C_2005_irr
#'
#' This module calculates production costs of GCAM commodities not including purchased irrigation water.
#'
#' @param command API command to execute
#' @param ... other optional parameters, depending on command
#' @return Depends on \code{command}: either a vector of required inputs,
#' a vector of output names, or (if \code{command} is "MAKE") all
#' the generated outputs: \code{L164.ag_Cost_75USDkg_C}. The corresponding file in the
#' original data system was \code{LB164.ag_Costs_USA_C_2005_irr.R} (aglu level1).
#' @details USDA cost data is used to calculate total production costs - purchased irrigation water costs for
#' GCAM commodities covered in USDA spreadsheets. This produces a commodity level water cost fraction for some
#' but not all GCAM commodities. L161.ag_irr_HA_frac_R_C_GLU irrigated vs rainfed harvested area data for the
#' covered GCAM commodities is used to form a linear model describing water cost fraction as a function of the
#' irrigated fraction of harvested area. This linear model then predicts the water cost fraction based on
#' irrigated fraction of harvested area for the missing commodities. Finally, cost data from LB133.ag_Cost_75USDkg_C
#' is adjusted as LB133_cost * (1 - water cost fraction) = production cost - purchased irrigation water for each
#' commodity.
