#' module_energy_LA100.IEA_downscale_ctry
#'
#' Downscale proprietary IEA energy balance data to 201 countries, by iso code, FLOW, PRODUCT, and historical year.
#'
#' @param command API command to execute
#' @param ... other optional parameters, depending on command
#' @return Depends on \code{command}: either a vector of required inputs,
#' a vector of output names, or (if \code{command} is "MAKE") all
#' the generated outputs: \code{L100.IEA_en_bal_ctry_hist}. The corresponding file in the
#' original data system was \code{LA100.IEA_downscale_ctry.R} (energy level1).
#' @details Combine OECD and non-OECD data; perform upfront adjustments for other Africa, Turkey, and South
#' Africa; split out and handle the 1990 split of Yugoslavia and USSR, back-projecting individual country
#' values based on 1990 shares; use population to downscale IEA composite regions (Other Africa, Other
#' non-OECD Americas, Other Asia) to individual countries; filter out countries without data in any year.
#' @note We build from the raw (and proprietary) \code{en_OCED} and \code{en_nonOECD} files if
#' they are available; if not, this chunk reads in a pre-generated \code{L100.IEA_en_bal_ctry_hist}
#' file and returns that. (In other words, our output is an optional input.)

      # The basic problem below is that for the USSR and Yugoslavia, for most years between 1971 and 1989, the IEA
      # didn't have much info on the sectoral allocation of fuel consumption, and a lot of the energy consumption
      # is assigned to flows like ONONSPEC (other non-specified) and INONSPEC (industry non-specified). In other words
      # the definition of the flows changes over the course of the time series.

      # This method is computing each (modern) nation's share of the total consumption of each product (i.e., fuel)
      # in 1990 within the composite nation (i.e., USSR and Yugoslavia). The appropriate total for each product/fuel
      # is set in the IEA_product_downscaling mapping file; the complication here is that the flow corresponding to
      # total consumption differs by fuel. Total consumption of most fuels is indicated by the TPES (total primary
      # energy supply) flow, but the TPES of secondary fuels (e.g., electricity, heat) is typically zero because
      # these aren't primary energy, so other flows like TFC (total final consumption) are used.
