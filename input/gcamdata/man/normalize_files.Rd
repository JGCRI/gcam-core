\usage{
normalize_files(root = system.file("extdata", package = "gcamdata"))
}
\arguments{
\item{root}{Folder root to scan, character}

}
\description{
Normalize line endings for all package input data.
}
\details{
Some GCAM input datafiles have bad line endings, and/or
don't have a final newline. This utility script converts all files to have Unix line endings (\code{\\n}) and a final newline.
}
\note{
Set \code{root} to "./extdata" in the git directory, not the package root, to make changes that 'stick'.
