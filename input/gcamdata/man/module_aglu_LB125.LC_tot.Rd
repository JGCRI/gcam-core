\description{
Build Total Land Cover by GCAM region, and by GCAM region and GLU, and by GCAM region/GLU/year.
}
\details{
This module builds three total land cover area data from the lower-level raw data:
1) total land area by GCAM region; 2) total land area by GCAM region and GLU; and
3) total land area by GCAM region, GLU and historical year. Units of the data are billion square meters.
The land area changing rates (bm2 per year) are checked to make sure they are within certain tolerances.
