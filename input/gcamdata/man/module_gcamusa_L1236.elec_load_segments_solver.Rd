\arguments{
\item{command}{API command to execute}

\item{...}{other optional parameters, depending on command}
}
\value{
Depends on \code{command}: either a vector of required inputs,
a vector of output names, or (if \code{command} is "MAKE") all
the generated outputs: \code{L1236.grid_elec_supply_USA}.

The corresponding file in the original data system was \code{LB1236.elec_load_segments_solver_2010.R} (gcam-usa level1).
