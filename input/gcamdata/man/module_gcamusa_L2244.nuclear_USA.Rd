\description{
Generates an add-on file to update nuclear assumptions in GCAM-USA.
}
\details{
This chunk creates an add-on file to update nuclear assumptions in GCAM-USA. Specifically, it reads in state-specific
s-curve retirement functions and lifetimes for existing nuclear vintage, based on planned retirements by state and nuclear power plant.
The current and future power generation data from existing nuclear plants in the USA is based on US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) of
nuclear reactor characteristic and operational history from January 2011, with additional updates to operating licenses and plant closures.
