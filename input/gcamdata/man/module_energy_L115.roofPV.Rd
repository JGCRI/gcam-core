\usage{
module_energy_L115.roofPV(command, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{command}{API command to execute}

\item{...}{other optional parameters, depending on command}
}
\value{
Depends on \code{command}: either a vector of required inputs,
a vector of output names, or (if \code{command} is "MAKE") all
the generated outputs: \code{L115.RsrcCurves_EJ_R_roofPV}. The corresponding file in the
original data system was \code{LA115.roofPV.R} (energy level1).
}
\description{
Convert rooftop PV resources from the 14 GCAM regions, i.e., "region_GCAM3", to the 32 GCAM region IDs.
}
\details{
Rooftop PV resources are given in the input file according to the 14 GCAM regions, i.e., "region_GCAM3." Because some regions span multiple GCAM region IDs, population in 2010 was used to allocate proportionally.
