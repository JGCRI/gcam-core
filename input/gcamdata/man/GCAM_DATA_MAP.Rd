GCAM_DATA_MAP
}
\description{
There are two levels of information available from the GCAM data system:
chunk dependencies, which are available for "free", i.e. with a fast query to
each chunk on the part of \code{chunk_inputs} and \code{chunk_outputs},
and detailed information on data object-level dependencies. This function is
used to generate this latter data, i.e. a tibble of chunk-output-precursor information,
which is used by \code{dstrace} and various other graphing and diagnostic utilities.
