\usage{
smooth_res_curve_approx_error(
  curve.exponent,
  mid.price,
  base.price,
  maxSubResource,
  supply_points
)
}
\arguments{
\item{curve.exponent}{smooth renewable resource curve shape parameter, numeric}

\item{mid.price}{the price at which 50 percent of the maximum available resource is produced, numeric}

\item{base.price}{the minimum cost of producing (generating electricity from) the resource}

\item{maxSubResource}{the maximum quantity of energy that could be produced at any price, numeric}

\item{supply_points}{a tibble of price and supply points along a resource curve in a region, numeric}
}
\value{
cross product of errors
}
\description{
Helper function to check how well a set of smooth renewable curve parameters matches the supply-points
from which the curve parameters are generated.
In gcamdata, this function is used in combination with stats::optimize to minimize the error of the
smooth renewable curve fit relative to the supply-points. Note that the first argument
(curve.exponent) is the one that is changed by optimize when trying to minimize the error.
The functional form of GCAM's smooth renewable resource curve is documented at:
