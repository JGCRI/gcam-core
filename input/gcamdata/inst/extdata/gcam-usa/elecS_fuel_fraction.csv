# File: elecS_fuel_fraction.csv
# Title: Fraction of electricity generation by fuel across horizontal load segments
# Units: unitless (fraction)
# Comments: This table provides initial estimates of the fractions of electricity generation by fuel by horizontal segment. The starting assumption is that 87.14% of coal is available for baseload generation and the remaining 12.85% is available for intermediate generation.
# Source: reasonable initial values for heuristic algorithm to begin
# Column types: ccnnnn
