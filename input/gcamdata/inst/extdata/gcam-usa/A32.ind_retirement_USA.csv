# Title: Parameters for S-curve shutdown decider and profit shutdown decider for U.S. industrial energy use
# Units: Years for lifetime and half.life; Unitless for steepness; median.shutdown.point; profit.shutdown.steepness
# Comments: lifetime = maximum lifetime of cohort. If no retirement function is used; the entire cohort is retired in this number of years.
#           half.life: number of years at which 50% of the cohort is retired; using the s-curve-shutdown-decider retirement function.
#           steepness: shape parameter used by the s-curve-shutdown-decider retirement function.
#           median.shutdown.point: profit-ratio at which 50% of the cohort is shut down for lack of profitability.
#           profit.shutdown.steepness: shape parameter of profit-shutdown-decider function.
# Source: None (GCAM assumptions)
# Column types: cccinini
