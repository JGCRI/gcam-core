# Title: Grid-Specific Subsector Shareweight Assumptions
# Units: unitless
# Comments: Subsector share weights for electricity passthrough sectors in the FERC (grid) regions at points of inflexion - adjusting values for particular grids
# Alaska is not allowed to export electricity in future model years.  It must export a small amount in historical periods to ensure that energy flows balance.
# Hawaii is not allowed to import electricity in future model years.  It must import a small amount in historical periods to ensure that energy flows balance.
