# Title: Non-Energy Inputs for Technologies Specific to the Multiple Load Segments Electricity Sector
# Units: capital costs - 1975 $/kW; fixed-om costs - 1975 $/kW; variable OM costs - 1975 $/MWh
# Comments: Non-energy inputs for new technologies that are not included in the energy system global technology database.  Shareweights are read in separately.
# Source: battery assumptions compiled from several sources (Lazard, 2016) (Schmidt et al., 2017) (Rastler, 2010) (Chen et al., 2009)
