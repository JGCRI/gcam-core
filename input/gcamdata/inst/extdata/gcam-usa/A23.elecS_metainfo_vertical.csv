# Title: Vertical Load Segment Supplysector Characteristics
# Units: unitless
# Comments: Vertical segment supplysector characteristics
# Same assumptions as energy/A23.sector.csv; corresponding to vertical (demand-side) electricity load segment sectors
# Electricity reserve margin: required excess capacity for purposes of grid reliability
# Average grid capacity factor: exogenous assumption allowing conversion between explicitly modeled generation and capacity
# Column types: ccnn
