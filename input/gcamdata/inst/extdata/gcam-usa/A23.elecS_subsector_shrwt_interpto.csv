# Title: Multiple Load Segments Subsector Shareweights
# Units: unitless
# Comments: Subsector shareweights for subsectors that are not fixed at calibration values. 
# These subsectors need a "to-value" which specifies the value to which the shareweight is being interpolated.
# Column types: ccccccic
