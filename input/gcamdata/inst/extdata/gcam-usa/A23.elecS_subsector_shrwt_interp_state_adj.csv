# Title: Multiple Load Segments Subsector Shareweights
# Units: unitless
# Comments: Subsector shareweights for subsectors that are fixed at calibration values.
# This table adjusts shareweights / interpolation functions for particular states.
# Hawaii is the only state which is allowed to deploy new refined liquids electric power plants in future model periods, because of its historical reliance on oil-fired electricity generation and geographic / resource constraints on alternative fuels (particularly natual gas).
