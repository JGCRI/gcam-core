# Title: Electric Generating Unit (EGU) emission factors for US states for plants built after 2015 
# Source: Dan Loughlin at EPA-ORD. For most pollutants these came from GREET. NOx SO2 and PM emissions came from IPM 
# Comments: Emission factors are assumed constant for all years
# Units: kilotonne per PJ fuel input
# Column types: cccn
