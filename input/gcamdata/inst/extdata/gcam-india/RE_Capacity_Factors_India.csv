# File: RE_Capacity_Factors_India.csv
# Title: Capacity factors by state by renewable technology
# Units: Unitless
# Comments: The data as been collected from various sources. For utility scale solar PV  Performance of solar power plants report by Central Electricty Regulartory Commision has been refered to
# The CUF for all the north-eastern states has been assumed same due to lack of data points. Literature states that the diff. between CUF of rooftop and utility scale solar is approx. 2% for the generation of a particualr capacity and thus  applied to each state
# The data from captive wind power generation for states is used as the representative data for state wise CUF of wind energy
# There is only a few CSP plants in the state of UP, RJ, AP and GJ. The factors are calcualted from the information provided for capacity and generation at NREL website
