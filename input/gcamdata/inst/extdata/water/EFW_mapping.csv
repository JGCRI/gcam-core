# File: EFW_mapping.csv
# Title: assignments between modeled energy-for-water (EFW) processes and intermediate energy system sectors
# Units: None
# Source: NA
# Comments: from.sector(2) indicates which sector(s) to re-assign energy from.
# Comments, continued: apply.to.desal.water indicates whether the EFW process applies to desalinated seawater used for municipal or industrial purposes.
# Column types: cccccccccci
