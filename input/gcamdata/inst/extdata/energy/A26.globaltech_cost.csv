# Title: Final energy delivery cost adders
# Units: 1975 USD/GJ
# Description: The added cost to producer prices to get final energy delivery prices. 0 values indicate the delivery cost is included elsewhere. Backup electricity costs represent the costs of a gas turbine to manage base load, but CSP backup is included in the primary tech cost.
