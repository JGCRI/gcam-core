# Title: H2A non-energy costs of hydrogen production technologies
# Units: Generally 2016$/kg, unless otherwise indicated
# Source: H2A is the DOE EERE Hydrogen program's analysis model (https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/h2a_analysis.html). H2A 2018 (generally), Results tab (2008 for nuclear thermal splitting)
# Comments: Non-energy cost = required selling price - feedstock costs. Max improvement = improvement_to_2040 + 10%, unless otherwise stated
