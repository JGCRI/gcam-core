# Title: ATB to GCAM technology mapping
# Units: unitless scaling factor
# Source: NA
# Comments: Mapping between ATB 2019 technologies and GCAM technologies.  Conversion factor of 1 indicates at 1:1 mapping between ATB & GCAM technologies.
# Some GCAM technologies do not correspond directly to technologies in the ATB data set and are inferred in some way - as described below:
# For technologies which are not included in the ATB database; we calculate the cost ratio (from the previous GCAM cost assumptions) relative to a technology which is included in the ATB database and apply that ratios to the costs for a technology which is in the ATB database.
# CSP ratio = CSP / CSP_storage
# biomass (IGCC) ratio = biomass (IGCC) / biomass (conv)
# biomass (conv CCS) ratio = biomass (conv CCS) / biomass (conv)
# biomass (IGCC CCS) ratio = biomass (IGCC CCS) / biomass (IGCC)
# coal (IGCC CCS) ratio = coal (IGCC CCS) / coal (IGCC)
# refined liquids (steam/CT) ratio = refined liquids (steam/CT) / gas (steam/CT)
# refined liquids (CC) ratio = refined liquids (CC) / gas (CC)
# refined liquids (CC CCS) ratio = refined liquids (CC CCS) / gas (CC CCS)
# Wind and PV with dedicated storage costs are assumed to equal costs of the underlying technologies plus four times the cost of ATB 2019's battery storage.
# This is because ATB reports costs for a 4-hour battery with 15-year lifetime. We assume an 8-hour battery with 30-year lifetime to be more consistent with storage requirements and technology lifetimes in GCAM.
# rooftop_pv costs represent a simple average of commerical and residential rooftop PV.
# rooftop PV technolgies entail a 1$/kW DC : 0.85$/kW AC conversion because Overnight Capital Cost; Fixed O&M; and Variable O&M costs represent $/kW(h) DC; all other techs are reported in $/kW(h) AC.  
# Also note that older versions of the ATB provided utility scale PV (UPV) costs in $/DC; the 2021 ATB provides UPV costs in $/AC; historical UPV costs have been adjusted accordingly.
# Note that ATB 2021 includes a Utility-Scale PV-Plus-Battery technology; this implementation does not use this technology but continues to combine Utility PV & Battery Storage cost assumptions to maintain consistent technical assumptiosn for PV_storage and wind_storage.
# inferred column indicates whether a technology cost is mapped directly from the ATB or is inferred via either (1) the shadow_tech cost ratio approach described above or (2) created from a composite of other technology costs (e.g. PV_storage costs are the sum of ATB PV costs and ATB Battery Storage costs).  This column is not used in the data processing.
