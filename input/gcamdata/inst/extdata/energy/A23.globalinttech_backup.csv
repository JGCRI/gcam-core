# Title: Electricity sector backup intermittent technology information
# Units: USD1975/kW/yr for 'backup.capital.cost'; Unitless for 'backup.capacity.factor'; Unitless for 'capacity.limit'
# Description: (1) Annualized capital cost per kW of backup capacity that intermittent renewable technologies may be required to purchase to ensure electrical supply reliability
# (2) Assumed capacity factor of purchased backup capacity
# (3) Mid-point of backup capacity requirement curve: an s-curve describing the amount of backup capacity required per unit of installed capacity of the given technology.
# This file corresponds to the previous (GCAM v7.1 and earlier) approach to representing variable renewable energy integration. This approach remains available but is not used by default.
