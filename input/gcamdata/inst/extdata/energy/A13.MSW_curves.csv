# Title: Supply curves of municipal solid waste (MSW), inherited from GCAM 3.0
# Units: varied (see below)
# Description: maxSubResource (EJ/yr): maximum amount of MSW production in the base year mid-price (1975$/GJ): price at which half of the maxSubResource is produced curve-exponent (unitless): shape parameter of S-surve supply function; gdpSupplyElast (unitless): maxSubResource elasticity of GDP
