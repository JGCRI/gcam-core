# Title: Electricity technology share weight interpolation
# Units: None
# Source: None (GCAM assumptions). Documented in Proposal 210_GCAM4p1_Electricity Generation Assumptions.pdf (page 20).
# Comments: If there are multiple technologies that are historically calibrated within a subsector; each technology must
#           have an interpolation function that smoothly interpolates the calibrated share-weight into the future.
#           This does not apply for subsectors with only single technology that is historically calibrated as a share-weight 
#           of 1 will be carried forward (coal biomass wind).
