# Title: Electricity technology variable operations and maintenance costs
# Units: 1975$/MWh
# Source: GCAM assumptions; developed from assumptions to NEMS model in support of the Annual Energy Outlook (https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/assumptions/pdf/electricity.pdf).
# Future improvement is based on the maximum % reduction that the literature deems likely and a rate corresponding to the maturity level of the technology
# Note that some technologies are the same as another with additional equipment (i.e. CCS) for those technologies the improvement is on the additional equipment
