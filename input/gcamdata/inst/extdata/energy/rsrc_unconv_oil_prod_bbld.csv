# Title: Historical unconventional oil production by country where applicable
# Units: million barrels of oil per day
# Source: For Canada use http://earlywarn.blogspot.com/2010/01/tar-sands-production-graph.html until 2010; use StatCan data for years beyond 2010 https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/tbl/csv/25100014-eng.zip for 2016 onwards https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=2510006301; for Venezuela IEA World Energy Outlook 2010 http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/media/weo2010.pdf; https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/830fe099-5530-48f2-a7c1-11f35d510983/WorldEnergyOutlook2022.pdf
# Comments: For Canada: download the data https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/tbl/csv/25100014-eng.zip; filter "Crude Bitumen" and "Synthetic crude oil" both of which qualify as unconventional oil according to the Data Quality Statement: https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&SDDS=2198 or https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/statistical-programs/document/2198_D1_T2_V1_B.pdf; for more recent data from 2023 filter "Non-upgraded production of crude bitumen" and "Synthetic crude oil production"; filter "Canada" and sum the VALUES for the year; multiple with VALUE *(6.289/365/1000). Example calculation for 2015; we get roughly 137552 (thousand cubic meters) * 6.28981 (barrels/cubic meter) / 1000 (convert thousands to millions) / 365 (days/year) which gets us 2.37 million barrels of unconventional oil per day. For Venezuela scale unconventional oil production according to total crude oil production (total crude oil production halves from 2015 to 2020)
