# Title: Aluminum technology lifetimes and shutdown rates
# Units: Years for lifetime and half.life; Unitless for shutdown.rate; steepness; median.shutdown.point; profit.shutdown.steepness
# Comments: maximum lifetime of cohort. If no retirement function is used; the entire cohort is retired in this number of years
#           shutdown.rate: portion of cohort retired each year; used by the phased-shutdown-decider retirement function.
#           half.life: number of years at which 50% of the cohort is retired; using the s-curve-shutdown-decider retirement function.
#           steepness: shape parameter used by the s-curve-shutdown-decider retirement function.
#           median.shutdown.point: profit-ratio at which 50% of the cohort is shut down for lack of profitability.
#           profit.shutdown.steepness: shape parameter of profit-shutdown-decider function.
