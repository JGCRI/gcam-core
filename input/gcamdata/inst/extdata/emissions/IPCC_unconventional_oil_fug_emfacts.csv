# Title: Fugitive emissions factors for unconventional oil production
# Description: Region-specific fugitive emissions factors for unconventional oil that differ from default in constants.R. Emissions factors calculated by adding the factor in the "onshore: oil sands mining and ore processing" in Table 4.2.4 and converting to Tg/EJ.  Note that "onshore: oil sands upgrading" was excluded since these emissions will be  included in GCAMâ€™s existing "refining and processing" emissions not "fugitive" emissions. The emissions factors used for all other regions (emissions.UNCONVENTIONAL.OIL.FUG.xxx.EMFACT in constants.R) were calculated from the emissions factors here as well as an emissions factor for "other unconventional oil" which is the average of the onshore unconventional oil exploration rows in Table 4.2.4 and onshore oil production rows in Table 4.2.4A. These two emissions factors were combined using a weighted average with weights (oil sands vs other unconventional) derived from estimated global unconventional oil resources (Source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876380416301112)

The oil sands emission factor is used for regions with historical production.
