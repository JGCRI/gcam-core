# Title: Minimum (i.e., fully controlled) emissions coefficients (unit emissions per unit fuel input or output, or something else) by technology and emissions species, for non-greenhouse gases
# Units: kg / GJ (or TgXXX / EJ, where XXX is the particular gas)
# Description: Minimum emissions coefficient for various technologies and gases. Emissions coefficients decline with GDP until these levels are reached, after which no further declines are possible.
# Source: GCAM3 emissions files (e.g., SO2 are from NonCO2_energy_input.xls, SO2_calcs tab, table starting at row 509)
# Column types: cccnnnnnn
