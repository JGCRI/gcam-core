# Title: EPA ammonia emissions
# Units: thousand short tons (?)
# Source: EPA National Emissions Trends
# Description: These EPA data files come from the old GCAM3 system (they were in nonco2/Input Data/EPA National Inventories). The documentation there is limited. For example, the CO file says: "National Emissions Trends -- updated 7/18/2005. Carbon Monoxide Emissions (thousand short tons)."
