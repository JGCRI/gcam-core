# File: SUA_item_code_map.csv
# Title: Mapping of SUA items to their item_code
# Units: NA
# Description: Ideally we just use SUA (supply utilization accounts) item names directly.  However, given the volume of data
# it helps to use item_code to reduce the size of the input data as well as speed up processing.  We will then need this mapping
# to ultimately translate back to item names. TM is TRUE when bilateral data was used for the item.
