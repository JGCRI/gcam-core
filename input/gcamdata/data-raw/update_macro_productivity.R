# Update the productivity assumption values by querying GCAM output for the calibrated values.
#
# Note that anytime a user runs with "FixedGDP-Path" set to 1 the model will calibrate a total
# factor productivity to match the exogenous GDP pathway that they described.  The gcamdata system
# supports generating a number of GDP pathway "scenarios", typically SSPs.  In addition the the
# gcamdata system will combine user assumptions about total factor productivity, defined in
# `socioeconomics/gcam_macro_TFP_open`., with the GDP "scenarios" so that users can also run
# "FixedGDP-Path" set to 0.
#
# However, the productivity assumptions may not exactly replicate the fixed GDP pathways if
# other assumptions or structure has changed significantly.  In which case the generated GDP
# pathways may diverge from their orignaly pathway.  In such a case a user may want to
# re-calibrate the total factor productivity assumptions.
#
# This is where this script fits in.  It will query a set of XMLDB results for new total factor
# productivity values and update the `socioeconomics/gcam_macro_TFP_open` assumptions file.  Given
# gcamdata supports multiple scenarios we set up a map gcamdata scenario name to the user's scenario
# name and path to the database where new values can be found.  By default this map is set up to
# replicate the structure of the GCAM validation runs: scenarios are named GCAM_<SSP> and each
# one is written to its own XMLDB (using the configuration option `append-scenario-name="1`).  However,
# users do not need to have new results for all scenarios.  Instead this script will do partial updates
# to `socioeconomics/gcam_macro_TFP_open` for which ever scenarios a user does indeed have results for.
# In addition we will tag the new results with `git describe` to help users understand from which version
# of GCAM were the productivity values in gcam_macro_TFP_open last updated.
#
# NOTE: this script only goes as far as updated the `socioeconomics/gcam_macro_TFP_open` assumptions file.
# A user will still need to re-run the gcamdata system (ideally with driver_drake to speed up the process)
# to produce the updated XML inputs for GCAM.

# Set up a table to map GCAM DB output including:
# - The scenario name in the DB
# - The path and name of the database to find the scenario
# And map that to the socioeconomic scenario names used in gcamdata
