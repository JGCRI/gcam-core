# Title: Global technologies efficiencies by fuel and electric sector,,,,,,,,,,,,
# Units: Unitless efficiency (electricity out / energy in),,,,,,,,,,,,
# Comments: Future improvement is based on the maximum % reduction that the literature deems likely and a rate. Note that some technologies are the same as another with additional equipment (i.e. CCS) for those technologies the improvement is on the additional equipment corresponding to the maturity level of the technology,,,,,,,,,,,,
