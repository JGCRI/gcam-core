# Title: Electricity technology retirement parameters,,,,,,,,,
# Units: Years for lifetime and half.life; Unitless for shutdown.rate; steepness; median.shutdown.point; profit.shutdown.steepness,,,,,,,,,
# Source: GCAM assumptions; generally consistent with other models.,,,,,,,,,
# Comments: lifetime: maximum lifetime of cohort. If no retirement function is used; the entire cohort is retired in this number of years.,,,,,,,,,
#           shutdown.rate: portion of cohort retired each year; used by the phased-shutdown-decider retirement function.,,,,,,,,,
#           half.life: number of years at which 50% of the cohort is retired; using the s-curve-shutdown-decider retirement function.,,,,,,,,,
#           steepness: shape parameter used by the s-curve-shutdown-decider retirement function.,,,,,,,,,
#           median.shutdown.point: Profit-ratio ((revenue - costs) / costs) at which 50% of cohort is shut down by profit shutdown decider. Only variable costs.,,,,,,,,,
#           profit.shutdown.steepness: shape parameter of profit-shutdown-decider function.,,,,,,,,,
