\usage{
module_energy_LA123.electricity(command, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{command}{API command to execute}

\item{...}{other optional parameters, depending on command}
}
\value{
Depends on \code{command}: either a vector of required inputs,
a vector of output names, or (if \code{command} is "MAKE") all
the generated outputs: \code{L123.out_EJ_R_elec_F_Yh}, \code{L123.in_EJ_R_elec_F_Yh}, \code{L123.eff_R_elec_F_Yh}, \code{L123.out_EJ_R_indchp_F_Yh}, \code{L123.in_EJ_R_indchp_F_Yh}. The corresponding file in the
original data system was \code{LA123.electricity.R} (energy level1).
