\usage{
module_gcamusa_L226.en_distribution_USA(command, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{command}{API command to execute}

\item{...}{other optional parameters, depending on command}
}
\value{
Depends on \code{command}: either a vector of required inputs, a vector of output names, or (if \code{command} is "MAKE") all
the generated outputs:
\itemize{
\item{\code{L226.DeleteSupplysector_USAelec}: Removing the electricity T&D sectors of the USA region.}
\item{\code{L226.StubTechCoef_electd_USA}: Stub technology coefficients elec T&D when using national elec markets. State elect_td sectors are treated as stub technologies.}
\item{\code{L226.TechShrwt_electd_USA}: tech share weights for elec T&D when using regional electricity markets. The elect_td sectors can not use the global tech database as their input is different.}
\item{\code{L226.TechCost_electd_USA}: Tech costs for elec T&D when using regional electricity markets.}
\item{\code{L226.TechCoef_electd_USA}: Tech coeff for elec T&D when using regional electricity markets.}
\item{\code{L226.Supplysector_en_USA}: Supply sector information for energy handling and delivery sectors for USA grid regions. Currently using FERC regions as a proxy for regional energy markets.}
\item{\code{L226.SubsectorShrwtFllt_en_USA}: Subsector shareweights of energy handling and delivery.}
\item{\code{L226.SubsectorLogit_en_USA}: Logit info for energy subsectors. There is only one tech per subsector so the logit choice does not matter.}
\item{\code{L226.TechShrwt_en_USA}: Technology shareweights of energy handling and delivery. Can't use stub technologies because these would inherit the wrong energy-inputs.}
\item{\code{L226.TechCoef_en_USA}: Technology coefficients and market names of energy handling and delivery.}
\item{\code{L226.TechCost_en_USA}: Regional price adjustments/cost adders for USA energy.}
\item{\code{L226.Ccoef}: Carbon coef for USA cost adder sectors.}
\item{\code{L226.Supplysector_electd_USA}: USA supply sector input, output, and logit info for elec T&D by state.}
\item{\code{L226.SubsectorLogit_electd_USA}: USA subsector logit info for elec T&D by grid_region.}
\item{\code{L226.SubsectorShrwtFllt_electd_USA}: USA subsector shareweight fillout for elec T&D by state.}
\item{\code{L226.SubsectorInterp_electd_USA}: USA interpolation info for elec T&D by state.}
