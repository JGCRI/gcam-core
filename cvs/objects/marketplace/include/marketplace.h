/*! 
 * \ingroup Objects
 * \brief The Marketplace is a global repository of information about the
 *        markets, or equations, in the model.
 * \details The Marketplace contains Markets, which may be created, modified,
 *          and accessed from throughout the model. A Market is created using
 *          the createMarket method. See IMarketType for the various types of
 *          Markets that can be created.
 *
 *          Each Market is created with a market region. This is independent of
 *          a Region in the model, and it may encompass multiple model Regions.
 *          It may be a global region, containing all Markets, may be a
 *          multi-region market, such as North America, or may contain a single
 *          model Region. A market region represents a area in which a good may
 *          move without a cost. Each model Region within the market region must
 *          call createMarket to be included in the market region. Each Market
 *          tracks model Regions it contains.
 *
 *          Markets are by default not solved. This means that price is not
 *          determined by the solution mechanism to equilibrate supply and
 *          demand. For unsolved Markets, prices must be set by the model, and
 *          supplies must be ensured to equal demands. The model will not
 *          successfully solve if unsolved markets are in disequilibrium. A
 *          market can be set to solve using setMarketToSolve. If a single
 *          region in a multi-region market sets the market to solve, all
 *          regions will see a solved price. An initial price may be set for
 *          solved markets. This will be used as the starting point for the
 *          solution search. Prices should not be set for solved markets after
 *          this point.
 *
 *          The main operations performed on markets once they are initialized
 *          are to get/set the price, get/set the supply and get/set the demand.
 *          Supplies and demands will be initialized to zero at the outset of
 *          each iterations. For solved markets, prices will be set by the
 *          solution mechanism to their trial values. For unsolved markets, they
 *          will remain at whatever value they were set to.
 *
 *          Markets also contain an IInfo object. This is a mapping of names to
 *          values. It should be used for additional information about the good
 *          in the market. It should not be used as a general method to transfer
 *          information around the model. Note that since a Market may contain
 *          multiple regions, the market info should not be used to store region
 *          specific values.
 *
 *          Market access functions have a flag, aMustExist, which specifies
 *          whether it is an error for the market to be missing. It should be
 *          set to true unless it is known to be possible for the market not to
 *          exist. The market will print a warning if the flag is true and the
 *          market does not exist. It will always return the default value when
 *          the market does not exist. The default value is 0 for supply,
 *          demand, and any info, and NO_MARKET_PRICE for prices.
 *
 * \author Sonny Kim
 * \todo ( re )storeInfo, init_to_last and initPrices should be removed.
 * \todo setPriceVector should be removed, it can be easily implemented using
 *       setPrice.
 * \todo An interface should be put in front of this class for model consumers.
 *       It should have limited functionality, offering only what is required.
 *       A separate interface should be created for solution mechanism specific
 *       items.
