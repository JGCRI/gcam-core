/*!
* \ingroup Objects
* \brief This class is responsible for rapidly looking up the location of a
*        market within the marketplace given region and good names.
* \details This class is designed to efficiently lookup the location of a market
*          within the Marketplace given the region of the object requesting the
*          lookup, and the name of the good they want to lookup information
*          about. This object is setup initially by the Marketplace through
*          calls to Marketplace::addMarket. During this function, the
*          Marketplace gives the MarketLocator the name of a market area, a
*          region, a good name, and a lookup number to use if the MarketLocator
*          does not already know the location of the market. The MarketLocator
*          stores this information in a pair of list. The first list contains
*          nodes which represent market areas. These nodes each store a list of
*          sectors and their corresponding sector numbers. This first list is
*          only used during the market creation process. The second list stored
*          by the MarketLocator is a list of nodes representing regions, each
*          containing a list of sectors and their market numbers. This is the
*          list which is used to determine a market number from a region name
*          and good name throughout the model run.
