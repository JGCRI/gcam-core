* \file main.cpp
* \todo Update this documentation.
* \brief This is the Main program file which controls initialization of run 
* parameters and sets up scenarios to run from input file names in the 
* Configuration file.
*
* The program reads in parameters and file names stored in the 
* configuration file and assigns them to the configuration object.  It creates 
* a scenario object and triggers a read-in of all input data by calling XMLParse.
* If there are scenario components (ScenComponents), then these are read next.
* 
* A switch is checked for the program to run in a mode that just merges files
* into one xml input file rather than running the model (mergeFilesOnly).
* 
* If the model is to be run, it is triggered by the ScenarioRunner class object, which 
* calls runScenarios() to trigger running of the complete model for all periods.
*
