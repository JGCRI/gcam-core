 * \brief A place holder to parse values from xml which can later be set
 *        into the appropriate solution info objects.
 * \details We must store these values while we are parsing since solution info
 *          objects are not created until it is time to solve a given period.  The
 *          values will be transfered from here to the appropriate solution info
 *          during the initialization of the solution info objects by the solver
 *          for the current period.  Note that parameters can be specified in the
 *          following ways and when a solution info matches multiple then parameters
 *          are merged with the first having lowest priority and last has highest:
 *              - Market type for all regions (no region attribute parsed).
 *              - Market type for a single region.
 *              - Fully qualified market by giving a good name and the region.
 *
 *          The solution info parameters which will be read are:
 *              - Solution Tolerance
 *              - Solution Floor
 *              - Bracket Interval
 *              - Max Newton Raphson Price Jump
 *              - Delta Price
