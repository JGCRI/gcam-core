 * \brief Functor for computing the GCAM excess demand in log space
 *
 * An instance of this class computes a vector of log relative excess
 * demand (log(demand) - log(supply) as a function of a vector of
 * inputs, for a set of markets determined at the time the object is
 * instantiated.  The inputs may be either prices or log(prices),
 * depending on a flag set in the constructor.
 *
 * \author Robert Link
 *
 * \todo: EDFun and LogEDFun share a lot of functionality.  We should
 * factor those shared functions into a base class so that both
 * classes can use it, rather than writing it independently in each
 * class.
