 * \brief Line search helper function for multidimensional root finders
 * \remark Because this function is defined as a template, we have to put the entire body in
 *         the header file.  It's ugly, and I don't like it, but the alternatives are worse,
 *         and nonportable to boot.

/*!
 * Perform a line search for use in multidimensional root finders.  This is NOT a 1-D
 * minimization routine!
 * \tparam FTYPE: floating point type.  Note we require the function have the same input and
 *                output types
 * \param[in]  f: A function adaptor for computing f(x) = F*F (for vector-valued F) 
 * \param[in] x0: Starting point for the step
 * \param[in] f0: Value of f(x0)
 * \param[in] g0: Value of grad-f(x0)
 * \param[in] dx: Proposed step from the root finder
 * \param[out] x: Final step determined by the search
 * \param[out] fx: Value of f(x)
 * \param[in] fxVec: The value of F(x)
 * \param[in] fxIncr: The maximum increase of f(x) we will allow to consider linesearch a success.
 * \param[inout]neval: number of function evaluations. The subroutine
 * adds whatever value is passed in, allowing the caller to keep a
 * running total.
 * \return : 0= success, anything else= fail
