 * \brief A class which defines an An instance of the Solver class which will follow
 *        a solving procedure completely determined by the solver xml config file.
 * \details The user will be responsible for setting up the solver components to use
 *          and providing the ordering of operations through parsing of the xml solver
 *          config file.
 *          <b>XML specification for UserConfigurableSolver</b>
 *          - XML name: \c user-configurable-solver
 *          - Contained by: scenario
 *          - Parsing inherited from class: None.
 *          - Elements:
 *              - \c solution-tolerance double UserConfigurableSolver::mDefaultSolutionTolerance
 *                      The default solution tolerance to use when solving.
 *              - \c solution-floor double UserConfigurableSolver::mDefaultSolutionFloor
 *                      The default solution floor to use when solving.
 *              - \c calibration-tolerance double UserConfigurableSolver::mCalibrationTolerance
 *                      The tolerance used for checking calibrated values when calibrating.
 *              - \c max-model-calcs int UserConfigurableSolver::mMaxModelCalcs
 *                      The maximum total number of iterations to try to find a solution.
 *              - \c (any SolverComponent) vector<SolverComponent*> UserConfigurableSolver::mSolverComponents
 *                      Can be any solver component contained in SolverComponentFactory, each one
 *                      being added in order to the list of solver components to use.
