/*! \brief An abstract class defining an interface to an independent component
*          of a Solver.
* \details A SolverComponent is an independent object which takes a Marketplace
*           and attempts to clear all markets to a given relative excess demand
*           tolerance within a given number of iterations. SolverComponents may
*           use static functions within the SolverLibrary class, they may not
*           however use other SolverComponents. This is the role of the Solver
*           object. The main method within a SolverComponent is the solve
*           method, which attempts to clear the markets.
