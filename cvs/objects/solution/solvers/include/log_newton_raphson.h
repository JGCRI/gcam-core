* \brief A SolverComponent based on the Newton-Raphson algorithm using logarithmic values.
* \details Newton-Raphson does a better job with markets are very interdependent compared
*          to bisections.  To capture the interactions between markets it is often a good
*          idea to include solution infos that are solved.  Newton-Raphson does rely on
*          calculating derivatives which is very computationally intensive and can also
*          diverge from the solution when it is not close or has to deal with non continuous
*          (supply - demand) curves.
