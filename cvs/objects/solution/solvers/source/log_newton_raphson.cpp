 * \param aSolutionSet The set of solutions infos which will be included in the derivative calculation.
 * \param JF The LU factorized derivative matrix or garbage if for some reason the calculation failed.
 * \param aPermMatrix A matrix to keep track of row operations done while factorizing the derivative
 *                    matrix.  This will be necessary when doing LU back substitution.
 * \param aPeriod The current model period.
 * \return A return code to indicate if the derivative calculation as well as the factorization was
 *         successful.  It is very important that this value be checked since if it failed JF will
 *         have garbage in it.
