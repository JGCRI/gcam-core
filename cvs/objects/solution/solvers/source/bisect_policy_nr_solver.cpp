/*! \brief Solution method to solve all markets for one period.
* \details This is the main solution function called from within the Marketplace. It is called once for each period to clear all 
* markets which should be solved. This solve method first brackets the markets, then uses several iterations of bisection_all to move 
* the prices into the range of the solution, and then uses Newton-Raphson to clear the markets.
* \param aPeriod The period to solve.
* \param aSolutionInfoParamParser An object that will be used to set solution info specific value
*                                 when they are initialized.
* \return Whether the markets all solved.
