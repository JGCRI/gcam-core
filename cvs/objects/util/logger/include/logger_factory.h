* \brief This is a proxy or wrapper class which allows the IParsable functions to be translated into
* the static LoggerFactory calls. This is required because a static class cannot have virtual functions,
* nor can it inherit them. This class does not have any data members, or functions not defined by the
* IParsable class. This class also ensures that the LoggerFactory::cleanUp method is called, so this wrapper 
* class should not be destroyed until the end of the model.
* \todo LoggerFactory should be converted to a singleton instead of a static class so that this is not 
* necessary.
