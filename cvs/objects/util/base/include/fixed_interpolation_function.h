 * \brief A fixed interpolation function.
 * \details This function simply returns the y-value of the left data point
 *          regardless of the values given for the right data point as well as
 *          the x-value to interpolate for.  Note that no error-checking is
 *          done by this interpolation function.
 *          <b>XML specification for FixedInterpolationFunction</b>
 *          - XML name: \c interpolation-function
