/*! 
* \ingroup Objects
* \brief This class is used as a container of configuration values which can be accessed throughout the program.
*
* The class is a singleton, so that only one can exist at any time during the program. It parses an XML file
* in the executable directory to instantiate its values. The values can be in one of 5 categories: files, strings,
* bools, ints, and doubles. To add a value it must only be added to the XML file in the appropriate section, the parser
* does not need to be changed. Then to access the variable, use the get method appropriate for the value's type.
*
* \author Josh Lurz
* \bug Bools are currently stored in XML as ints due to conversion problems.
* \warning The class is a singleton, so it may not be created with the constructor. Instead call getInstance to return a pointer to the instance.
* \warning The user must call delete on the object when they are finished with it.
