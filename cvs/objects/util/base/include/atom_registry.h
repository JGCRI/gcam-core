    * \brief A registry that is responsible for tracking all Atoms created by the
    *        model.
    * \details The AtomRegistry is a class which tracks all Atoms within the model
    *          and ensures they are unique. It also is responsible for deallocating
    *          Atoms. The AtomRegistry is a singleton class which is only accessible
    *          through the static getInstance function. This returns the global
    *          instance of the registry. Registries cannot be allocated and the
    *          single instance is deallocated automatically when the model
    *          completes. The registry will deallocate all registered Atoms at this
    *          time. When Atoms are created they automatically register themselves
    *          with the registry. The registry ensures at this time that the atoms
    *          are unique. Non-unique atoms are not registered and will leak memory
    *          as they will never be deallocated. Atoms cannot be registered outside
    *          of their constructors. Registered atoms are kept for the entire
    *          lifetime of the model. They may be fetched using the findAtom
    *          function which searches the internal hashmap to find the requested
    *          Atom.
