 * \brief A S-curve interpolation function.
 * \details Interpolate a value by constructing an S-curve which connects
 *          the left and right data points and evaluating that curve at the
 *          given x-value.  Tuning parameters to shape the S-curve are parsed.
 *          TODO: what do we do about errors?
 *          <b>XML specification for SCurveInterpolationFunction</b>
 *          - XML name: \c interpolation-function
 *          - Contained by:
 *          - Parsing inherited from class: None.
 *          - Attributes:
 *              - \c name = s-curve
 *                      The XML name attribute value which differentiates this
 *                      IInterpolationFunction from the others.
 *          - Elements:
 *              - \c steepness double SCurveInterpolationFunction::mSteepness
 *                      Adjustment parameter to control steepness of the s-curve,
 *                      the higher the number the steeper the curve.
 *              - \c median-x-value double SCurveInterpolationFunction::mMedianXValue
 *                      Adjustment parameter to control at which x-value will the s-curve
 *                      equal the median of the y-values from the left and right
 *                      data points when interpolating.
