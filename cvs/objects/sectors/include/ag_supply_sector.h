/*!
 * \brief A sector which supplies ag products.
 * \details AgSupplySector differs from the standard supply sector class in one 
 *          critical area - Ag supply sectors are solved markets and determine
 *          their supply indepedently.
 *
 *          1. so methods that set supply equal to demand inside this class are 
 *             overwritten. Instead output is determined by the sum of contained
 *             AgTechnology objects that are based on land allocations and yield
 *
 *          2. the setMarket method is overwritten here to allow a marketname
 *             that can be multi-region (e.g., global)
 *
 *          3. the getPrice method is overwritten to get a price from the
 *             market rather than compute average cost like standard sector
 *
