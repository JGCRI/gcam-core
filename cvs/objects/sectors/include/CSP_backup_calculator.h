 * \brief The backup calculator for the CSP (concentrated solar trough) technology.
 * \details Calculates the amount of backup energy required per unit of output. This
 *          differs from the capacity_limit_backup_calculator in that the CSP
 *          backup retunrs energy reuqired rather than capacity.<br>
