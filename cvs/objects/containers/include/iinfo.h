* \ingroup Objects
* \brief This interface represents a set of properties which can be accessed by
*        their unique identifier.
* \details The IInfo interface represents a set of searchable properties
*          accessed by their string key. The properties may be booleans,
*          integers, double or strings. Operations exist to set or update values
*          for a key, query if a key exists, and get the value for a key.
* \todo Evaluate whether functions to add to a double value, and update an
*       average would be useful as additions to the interface.
* \todo Add longevity to properties.
