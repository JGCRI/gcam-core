 * \brief A scenario runner which reads in set of input files and runs multiple
 *        scenarios by determining all possible permutations of these sets of
 *        files.
 * \details This class runs multiple scenarios by creating combinations of the
 *          sets of files within each component. For each scenario, one file set
 *          from each component will be chosen. It will continue running
 *          scenarios until all possible combinations have been run. This may
 *          also be used to run a simple set of scenarios by defining a single
 *          component with one file set for each run.
 *
 *          A special type of component set may also be read which is the
 *          runner-set. Only a single runner set may be read, and each element
 *          in the runner set represents a type of ScenarioRunner to use.
 *          ScenarioRunners in the runner-set will be used similarly to
 *          FileSets, permutations will be created for each member. Only one
 *          runner-set may be read, if none are read a ScenarioRunner will be
 *          created from the values in the configuration file as would occur in
 *          a single scenario run.
 *          
 *          The batch runner is turned on using the boolean configuration value
 *          "BatchMode". The name of the configuration file is determined by the
 *          file configuration value "BatchFileName".
