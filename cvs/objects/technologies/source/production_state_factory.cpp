/*
* \brief Create the production state for a Technology in a given period.
* \details This function is called at the beginning of each period to create an
*          object that determines how a Technology will determine its output
*          level for the period. All Technologies begin in a retired state, this
*          represents that they have not been built yet. In the initial
*          production period of a Technology, it will set its production state
*          to either fixed or variable. The fixed state is used when a level of
*          fixed investment is specified by the data, the variable state is used
*          otherwise. In the period after the Technology's initial production
*          period, the Technology will change it's production state to either
*          vintaged or retired. Vintaged Technologies will continue in the same
*          state until their lifetime is exceeded at which point they will enter
*          the retired state. Retired Technologies do not produce any output.
* \param aInvestYear The year in which the Technology was new investment.
* \param aLifetimeYears The maximum number of years the Technology may operate.
* \param aFixedOutput The fixed output level, or
*        IProductionState::fixedOutputDefault if there is none.
* \param aInitialOutput The output in the initial operating period of the
*        technology, or IProductionState::fixedOutputDefault if it cannot be
*        calculated.
* \param aPeriod Model period.
