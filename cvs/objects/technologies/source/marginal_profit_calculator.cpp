    one situation (i.e., bio+CCS where the carbon credit exceeds the costs of using
    biomass) where, at least as the model defines it, variable costs can be negative.
    In this case, marginal profit will always be very positive, so there should be no
    problem introduced by using the absolute value in the denominator. In the vast
    majority of situations, variable costs will be positive and using absolute value
    will have no impact. A Very Small Number is also added to the denominator in case
	that the variable cost is zero, as it could be with renewables, which should
	not be shut down based on marginal profit either (MAW 8-6-09) */
