 * \brief An output representing a secondary output of the Technology.
 * \details Secondary outputs represent a product produced in conjunction with a
 *          primary product which may have a positive value. Output of the
 *          secondary output is not optimized, it is always produced at a fixed
 *          ratio to the primary output, and may not be discarded. The revenue
 *          from the secondary output must not exceed the cost of the primary
 *          output. The secondary output must be the primary output of another
 *          sector, and the total secondary output of the good must not exceed
 *          demand.
 *          
 *          <b>XML specification for SecondaryOutput</b>
