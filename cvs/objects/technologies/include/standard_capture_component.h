 * \ingroup Objects
 * \brief This object is added on to Technologies so that they can sequester
 *          their emissions instead of emitting them. 
 * \details This object is responsible for controlling and calculating the cost
 *          for sequestered emissions using simple multiplicative penalties on
 *          efficiency and non-energy cost. The standard capture component
 *          applies multiplicative penalties to the non-energy costs and the
 *          Technology efficiency. A separate storage cost per unit of
 *          sequestered emissions is also calculated, this is determined by a
 *          storage market if one was read in and exists, or a fallback read-in
 *          per unit cost. The fraction of emissions sequestered is determined by
 *          a read-in value.<br>
 *
 *          Effective efficiency is calculated as:
 *          \f[ H_{effective} = H_{technology} * (1-H_{penalty}) \f]
 *
 *          where
 *              - \f$H_{technology}\f$ is the efficiency of the technology.
 *              - \f$H_{penalty}\f$ is the efficiency penalty due to capture.
 *
 *          Total non-energy cost with capture applied is calculated as:
 *          \f[ NE_{total} = (NE_{technology} + (1 + NE_{adder}) \f]
 *
 *          where
 *              - \f$NE_{technology}\f$ is the non-energy cost of the technology.
 *              - \f$NE_{adder}\f$ is the non-energy cost adder.
 *
 *          Total captured emissions are calculated as:
 *          \f[ E_{captured} = RF * (C_{fuel} * I - C_{product} * O) \f]
 *
 *          where
 *              - \f$RF\f$ is the fraction of emissions captured.
 *              - \f$C_{fuel}\f$ is the emissions coefficient of the fuel.
 *              - \f$I\f$ is the input consumed by the technology.
 *              - \f$C_{product}\f$ is the emissions coefficient of the product.
 *              - \f$O\f$ is the output of the technology.
