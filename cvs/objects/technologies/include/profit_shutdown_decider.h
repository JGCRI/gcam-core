 * \brief This object begins to shut down a vintage when its profit rate falls
 *        below a minimum level.
 * \details Profit shutdown decider which applies a logistic S-shaped curve
 *          to determine the shutdown rate. The proportion shutdown is based
 *          the percentage that the price receive exceeds or is below variable cost.<br>
 *
 *
 *
 *          functional form of profit shutdown decider is
 *          
 *          shutDownRate = mMaxShutdown * (1 + medianShutdownPoint) ^ mSteepness /
 *                           ((1 + medianShutdownPoint) ^ mSteepness + (1 + profitRate) ^ mSteepness)
 *                  where  mMaxShutdown is the maximum shutdown fraction (defaults to 1)
 *                         mSteepness is a shape parameter of curve steepness to reach Max              
 *                         profitRate is the percentage that price exceeds variable cost
 *                         medianShutdownPoint is the profitRate where 50% is shutdown
 *                             shutDownRate will be 50% when profitRate = 0 when medianShutdownPoint=0.
