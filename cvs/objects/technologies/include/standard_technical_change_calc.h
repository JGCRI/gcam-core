 * \brief This object is added on to Technologies to allow for Hicks-Neutral,
 *        material, and energy technical change to be applied to the inputs.
 * \details This object is responsible for calculating the cumulative
 *          Hicks-Neutral and input specific technical change. Hicks-Neutral is
 *          applied to all inputs through an out front scalar calculated by this
 *          class. Energy and Material technical change is applied to the
 *          coefficients of all energy or material inputs that do not read in an
 *          input specific technical change. An input cannot be both energy and
 *          material.
