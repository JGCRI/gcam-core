 * \brief A technology container which indicates that the actual technology conatiner
 *        to use should be pulled from the GlobalTechnologyDatabase.
 * \details Parsing XML into a StubTechnology is allowed and will have the effect
 *          of making adjustments to the local copy of the TechnologyContainer
 *          from the GlobalTechnologyDatabase.  The global technology will get
 *          copied during completeInit and adjustments will be made then by
 *          calling XMLParse on the copied container.  All other ITechnologyContainer
 *          calls are merely forwared to the local copy of the global technology.
 *          The stub technology also allows  interpolating a technology before making
 *          adjustments by setting the allow-interpolate attrubute to true.
 *
 *
 *          <b>XML specification for StubTechnologyContainer</b>
 *          - XML name: -c StubTechnologyContainer::getXMLNameStatic()
 *          - Contained by: Subsector
 *          - Parsing inherited from class: None
 *          - Attributes: name The name of the technologies contained.
 *                        allow-interpolate Whether the XML adjustments with in
 *                        this stub-technology tab may interpolate a technology
 *                        in order to parse then data.
 *          - Elements:
 *              Any XML what so ever.  These elements will be kept around and will
 *              not be parsed until completeInit by the local copy of the global
 *              technology.  This means that parsing error will occur at that time.
