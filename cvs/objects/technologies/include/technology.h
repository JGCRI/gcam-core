/*! 
 * \ingroup Objects
 * \brief This Technology class is based on the MiniCAM description of
 *        technology.
 * \details The technology class is where all fuels are either consumed or
 *          transformed. This class has options for calibration, fixed output,
 *          vintaging, emissions, secondary outputs, and carbon capture and
 *          storage.
 *
 *          The Technology class behavior is determined by a series of
 *          components which modify the behavior of the Technology. The
 *          components are as follows:
 *
 *         - Outputs. Output objects are stored in the mOutputs vector and
 *           defined by the IOutput interface. Output objects determine the
 *           level of output for a good based on the output determined by the
 *           Technology for the primary output. They may also assign a cost or
 *           value for the output. All technologies have at least one output,
 *           the primary output. This object is created automatically by the 
 *           Technology.
 *
 *         - Emissions. Emissions objects are stored in the ghg vector and
 *           defined by the AGHG interface. Emissions objects are similar to
 *           output objects, they determine a level of emissions from the
 *           primary output, or other factors such as the current income level,
 *           and determine a cost(such as a tax, or sequestration cost), or
 *           value(in the case of a negative emission). Emissions interact with
 *           the Technology's optional capture component to determine the cost
 *           of sequestration and the fraction of emissions captured.
 *
 *         - Capture component. A Technology may optionally have a single
 *           capture component that is stored in mCaptureComponent and
 *           represented by the ICaptureComponent interface. The Technology will
 *           call the capture component to adjust the Technology's non-energy
 *           cost and effective efficiency. The Technology also passes the
 *           capture component to the GHGs so that they may adjust their
 *           emissions, taxes and costs accordingly.
 *
 *         - Shutdown deciders. Shutdown deciders are stored in the
 *           mShutdownDeciders vector and are represented by the
 *           IShutdownDecider interface Shutdown deciders are only affect
 *           Technologies in the vintage output state; they do not affect new
 *           investment. Shutdown deciders determine the percentage of the
 *           initial output level to produce in a later period. The effects of
 *           the shutdown deciders are multiplicative.
 *
 *         - Calibration data. A Technology may optionally have a single
 *           calibration data object, stored in mCalValue and represented by the
 *           ICalData interface. The calibration object is responsible for
 *           determining the level of input and output in the new investment
 *           period, assuming that the period is defined to be a calibration
 *           period by the Modeltime.
 *
 *         - Production state. The production state for each period is stored in
 *           the mProductionState vector and represented by the IProductionState
 *           interface. The production state is responsible for determining the
 *           level of output of the Technology for each period. It contains
 *           information about whether the Technology is new investment, a
 *           vintage, fixed output, or retired. The production state is
 *           dynamically created by the Technology for each period. See
 *           ProductionStateFactory::create for an explanation of which
 *           production state is created for each point in the lifecycle of a
 *           Technology.
 *
 * \todo Document input.
 * \todo Better document the plug-in points for the derived classes.
 * \note Technology is the abstract base class for the various Technology
 *       implementations. It contains default implementations of the abstract
 *       functions which may be called by the derived classes to perform the
 *       default actions.
