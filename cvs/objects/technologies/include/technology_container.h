/*! 
 * \ingroup Objects
 * \brief This class contains technologies of the same type (name) and manages parsing and
 *        access to the contained technologies.
 * \details The container will allow technology vintages to be defined in arbitrary
 *          years.  It will take care of interpolating technologies as necessary and
 *          can enforce that a technology can not exist before  or after a given year.
 *          This technology container also acts as a factory for creating technology
 *          objects.
 *
 *          <b>XML specification for TechnologyContainer</b>
 *          - XML name: -c TechnologyContainer::hasTechnologyType
 *          - Contained by: Subsector, GlobalTechnologyDatabase
 *          - Parsing inherited from class: None
 *          - Attributes: name The name of the technologies contained.
 *          - Elements:
 *              - \c initial-available-year TechnologyContainer::mInitialAvailableYear
 *                   An optional paramater which specifies the first year a
 *                   vintage is allowed.  This does not have to be a model year.
 *              - \c final-available-year TechnologyContainer::mFinalAvailableYear
 *                   An optional paramater which specifies the last year a
 *                   vintage is allowed to be invested in.  This does not have to
 *                   be a model year.
 *              - \c InterpolationRule::getXMLNameStatic() TechnologyContainer::mShareWeightInterpRules
 *                   - Attributes: apply-to
 *                      What the interpolation rule applies to, currently only
 *                      share-weight is recognized.  Note that the delete=1 attribute
 *                      is recognized and in this case will be interpreted as delete
 *                      any rules which have already been parsed.
 *                   Interpolation rules which can be used to control the behavior of
 *                   technology share-weights.  Note that parsing multiple rules will
 *                   stack instead of replacing to allow building complex rules.
 *              - \c Technology::getXMLVintageName() TechnologyContainer::mVintages
 *                   - Attributes: year
 *                      The year of the technology vintage which does not have to be
 *                      a model year.
 *                   The actual technology vintage which will be created through
 *                   TechnologyContainer::createAndParseVintage
