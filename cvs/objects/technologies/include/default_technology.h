 * \brief Technology which represents a simple MiniCAM technology.
 * \details The Technology class is where all fuels are either consumed or
 *          transformed. The DefaultTechnology class is based on a MiniCAM-style
 *          logit representation. This class has options for calibration, fixed
 *          output, capture of emissions, and secondary outputs. The class is
 *          used for both supply and demand of goods.
 * \note DefaultTechnology uses implementations of functions shared with other
 *       Technology subclasses. This is done by including implementations of
 *       abstract functions in Technology. DefaultTechnology's implementations
 *       of those abstract functions call the Technology implementations.
