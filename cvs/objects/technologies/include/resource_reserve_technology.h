 * \brief A type of technology that has a cumulative resource base set when initially
 *        invested and produces from that resource base at some annualized rate until
 *        it has been fully depleted.
 * \details This class will work in conjunction with a ReserveSubResource for calculating
 *          new investment.  This technology is still subject to shutdown deciders, cost
 *          adders, emissions which may affect the level of vintaged production the same
 *          as any other technology.  However when calculating profit shutdown we tack on
 *          additional "investment" cost which is reflective of where on the supply curve
 *          the containing ReserveSubResource was.

 *                   A parameter which can phase in annual production over the given

 *                   A parameter which can be used to linearly phase out annual production
 *                   after the remaining reserve has reached the configured percent.
