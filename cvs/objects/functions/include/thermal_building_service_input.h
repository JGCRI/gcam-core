/*! 
 * \ingroup Objects
 * \brief An input class which demands heating or cooling building services.
 * \details Building services will operate with a building service function which
 *          will gradually satiate demands as affordability of the service increases
 *          and is adjusted for changing climate and building characteristics.
 *
 *          <b>XML specification for ThermalBuildingServiceInput</b>
 *          - XML name: \c ThermalBuildingServiceInput::getXMLNameStatic()
 *          - Contained by: BuildingNodeInput
 *          - Parsing inherited from class: None
 *          - Attributes: \c name BuildingServiceInput::mName
 *          - Elements:
 *              - \c base-service BuildingServiceInput::mServiceDemand
 *                   The base year service which can be utilized to back out
 *                   coefficients.
 *              - \c internal-gains-scalar ThermalBuildingServiceInput::mInternalGainsScalar
 *                   The extent which internal gains effects the thermal load requirement.
 *              - \c degree-days ThermalBuildingServiceInput::mDegreeDays
 *                   Total number of degree * days in a year that the heating or cooling service
 *                   is required.
 *              - \c SatiationDemandFunction::getXMLNameStatic() BuildingServiceInput::mSatiationDemandFunction
 *                   The self contained satiation demand function which will parse it's own
 *                   parameters.
