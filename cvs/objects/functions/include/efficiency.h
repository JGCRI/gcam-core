 * \brief Defines an efficiency for an input in a production function.
 * \details The efficiency for an input in a production function is equal to the
 *          amount of output produced per unit of input(output/input). This
 *          class defines an efficiency which is internally converted to an
 *          intensity for use in production functions. Efficiencies are intended
 *          to more easily represent single energy-input production functions.
 *          Coefficients(intensities) should be used for multi-energy-input
 *          production functions.
