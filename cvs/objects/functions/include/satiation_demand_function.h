/*!
 * \ingroup Objects
 * \brief A function which asymptotes to a specified level (satiation level) as
 *        the driver approaches infinity.
 * \details The satiation demand function represents consumption behavior where demand 
 *			for a good or service increases with its affordability, but ultimately reaching 
 *			a satiation point. The expression represents a reduced-form demand choice that 
 *			maximizes non-conventional utility under budget constraint, where marginal utility
 *			does not continue to be positive but becomes negative at some level which 
 *			we call the satiation point. More information about the underlying economics, 
 *			see Eom et al. (PNNL 21073, 2012). Examples include demands for space heating, 
 *			space cooling, and water heating. 
 *			This object is designed to be self contained and flexible such that it
 *          may be used for multiple purposes.  Thus the parameters and arguments
 *          are generically named, for instance the demand driver could be income or
 *          affordability.  The function has a shape parameter satiation adder to
 *          provide a subsistence level, as well as the satiation impedance which is defined
 *          as the value of the demand driver that is half way to the satiation level.
 *          Satiation impedance is calibrated internally through the method
 *          calibrateSatiationImpedance. The satiation level itself may be specified
 *          exogenously or as a percentage increase to the demand level given during
 *          calibration.  The functional form this class represents is as follows:
 *
 *          service density = ( satiation level - satiation adder ) 
 *                 * ( 1 - e^( -log(2) / satiation impedance * demand driver ) ) + satiation adder
 *
 *          <b>XML specification for SatiationDemandFunction</b>
 *          - XML name: \c SatiationDemandFunction::getXMLNameStatic()
 *          - Contained by: Many classes.
 *          - Parsing inherited from class: None
 *          - Attributes: none
 *          - Elements:
 *              - \c satiation-level SatiationDemandFunction::mParsedSatiationLevel
 *                   The exogenously specified asymptote of this function.  Parsing
 *                   this value precludes the use of satiation-base-year-increase.
 *              - \c satiation-base-year-increase SatiationDemandFunction::mBaseYearSatiationMultiplier
 *                   A multiplier of the demand used during calibration to use to
 *                   set mSatiationLevel.  Parsing this value precludes the use of 
 *                   satiation-level.
 *              - \c satiation-adder SatiationDemandFunction::mParsedSatiationAdder
 *                   Shape parameter which represents the subsistence level or the
 *                   minimum demand when the driver is zero.  Optional parameter.
