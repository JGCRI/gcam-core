* \brief The climate model interface allows emissions of various gases to be
*        passed into a climate model and output from the climate model to be
*        printed to a database and text file. This interface is currently
*        limited and does not expose any output. Classes implementing this
*        interface must be able to accept emissions by gas and print output to a
*        database and CSV file. This output must include CO2 concentrations.
