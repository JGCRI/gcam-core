/**
 * A helper class which gives GCAM a simple interface for adding or appending
 * XML to a BaseX database.  GCAM can create an instance of this class
 * giving the database location and the name of the document to add.  It
 * can then receive the data and stream it into the database by reading a buffer
 * via the receiveDataFromGCAM method.  When all data has been sent the finish
 * method is called which will wait until the BaseX has finished adding all of
 * the data.  Users can optionally configure this class to:
 *  - Apply a filter on the XML as it is streamed into the database.
 *  - Run a Model Interface batch file to execute queries after a GCAM scenario has
 *    finished running.
 *  - Create the database in memory so that they can be queries and discarded without
 *    the performance penalty to writing thmm to disk.
