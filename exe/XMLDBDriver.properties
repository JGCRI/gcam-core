<comment>Configuration properties to control the behavior of storing GCAM output into the XML database.</comment>
<!-- If the results should put into an in memory database.
     WARNING: this means the data will be lost once the DB is closed.
     This option would be useful if the user wanted to run queries on the results then
     discard them.  Also note that GCAM will still be holding it's memory while this DB
     is created.

<entry key="in-memory">false</entry>
<!-- The path to an STX style script to filter GCAM results before writing them to the
     DB.  If empty no filters will be applied.
-->
<entry key="filter-script"></entry>
<!-- The path to a Model Interface batch file to run queries after a GCAM run has
     finished.  Note that GCAM will wait to run these queries until after the scenario
     has cleaned up it's memory to create more space for the Model Interface and to
     ensure all results (including cost curves) are available.  If empty no queries
     will be run.

<!-- Redirect the log messages from running batch queries to the specified log file.
     Note that an empty value will keep the messages printing to the standard output.
