<comment>Configuration properties to control the behavior of storing GCAM output into the XML database.</comment>
<!-- If the results should put into an in memory database.
     WARNING: this means the data will be lost once the DB is closed.
     This option would be useful if the user wanted to run queries on the results then
     discard them.  Also note that GCAM will still be holding it's memory while this DB
     is created.
-->
<entry key="in-memory">false</entry>
<!-- A timeout, in seconds, to wait in case a user tries to write to an already open DB.
     A negative value indicates to wait indefinately.  Once the timeout has expired or
     a user has pressed any button it will attempt to open the DB once more and if that
     fails again then the results will be lost.
-->
<entry key="open-db-wait">-1</entry>
<!-- The path to an STX style script to filter GCAM results before writing them to the
     DB.  If empty no filters will be applied.
-->
<entry key="filter-script">../output/queries/filters/default_filter.xml</entry>
<!-- The path to a Model Interface batch file to run queries after a GCAM run has
     finished.  If a value of - is specified this instrucnts the Model Interface
     to read the batch file from STDIN which could be useful when being run by some
     other controlling program that wants to dynamically generate the queries to run.
     Note that GCAM will wait to run these queries until after the scenario
     has cleaned up it's memory to create more space for the Model Interface and to
     ensure all results (including cost curves) are available.  If empty no queries
     will be run.
-->
<entry key="batch-queries"></entry>
<!-- Redirect the log messages from running batch queries to the specified log file.
     Note that an empty value will keep the messages printing to the standard output.
